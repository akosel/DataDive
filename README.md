DataDive
========
This repository is the code for the interactive visualization created for the AAACF the Fall 2013 A2DataDive.

We used this tool to convert the csv to json:

For the Cloudmade service--which the map is created with--I have an API key, but when we put the viz on the AAACF site, we may need to modify the site name or
or create a new account for them. Probably that would be ideal.
